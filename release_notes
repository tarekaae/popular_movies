1- define a call to "movie/top_rated" API  in "MovieAPI" interface
2- define a call to "movie/popular" API  in "MovieAPI" interface
3- call the new APIs
4- remove the local sort methods
5- adding the property ( android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize" ) to the activities to lock reloading the app state ( just for project 1) / I handled the dialog too
6- tweak the layout to handle no image case , i put it inside layout and used View.invisible instead of gone
7- tried to store the api key in an env var and get it from gradle but couldn't , I will postpone it after gradle course
